# Why I wrote FWS 3000

FWS is an acronym for Free Will Simulator. I came at the concept from
two angles:

1. It's a reflection on the garden of Eden story told in
   [the third chapter of Geneis](http://www.taggedtanakh.org/Chapter/Index/english-Gen-3). As
   a Christian who believes in original sin, the story of the serpent
   and the fruit is foundational to my system of belief and a constant
   challenge to it. Ultimately, the story[^1] explains that because
   God desired humans to have free will, we were able to bring evil
   into the world.

2. The game considers the supreme power of the author within a story
   that compels the choices each character makes. Stories told in
   games are limited by the options the developers provide. Even open
   world games reveal themselves as illusions the longer you play.

[^1]: I tend to think it is an allegory, but would not be surprised to
    find out that there was an actual garden with an actual tree of
    knowledge of good and evil.
