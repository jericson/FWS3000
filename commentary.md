# Why I wrote FWS 3000

FWS is an acronym for Free Will Simulator. I came at the concept from
two angles:

1. It's a reflection on the garden of Eden story told in
   [the third chapter of Geneis](http://www.taggedtanakh.org/Chapter/Index/english-Gen-3). As
   a Christian who believes in original sin, the story of the serpent
   and the fruit is foundational to my system of belief and a constant
   challenge to it. Ultimately, the story[^1] explains that because
   God desired humans to have free will, we were able to bring evil
   into the world. We were given truly free choices to the point God
   sacrificed his own son to rescue us from our bad decisions.

2. The game considers the supreme power of the author within a story
   that compels the choices each character makes. Stories told in
   games are limited by the options the developers provide. Even open
   world games reveal themselves as illusions the longer you
   play. Because game worlds must be limited in one way or another, we
   never have as many choices as we might wish.

Text in square brackets [like this] is intended to be commentary by an
imaginary game studio making the game.[^2] I'm sure they are very good
at what they do, but games are hard to make and players do the most
bizarre things. Sometimes, they just end up in places where you don't
expect them.

[^1]: I tend to think it is an allegory, but would not be surprised to
    find out that there was an actual garden with an actual tree of
    knowledge of good and evil.

[^2]: Hopefully that was already true, but just to be clear about it.
