# Contributing to the game

I'm interested in improving FWS 3000 and welcome any and all
pull-requests. I'm especially interested in getting more descriptions
of the garden. What do _you_ think would be present in a natural
paradise?

I'm using the [Ink scripting language](https://github.com/inkle/ink),
which is the best tool I've found for writing interactive fiction. If
you'd like to contribute, grab a copy of either the
[Inky editor](https://github.com/inkle/inky/releases) or the
[inklecate command line compiler](https://github.com/inkle/ink/releases). Either
allow you to play through any changes you make.

I'm annotating the code with `TODO:` labels, which should give you an
idea of what needs doing.
